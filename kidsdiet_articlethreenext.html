<h5>Psychological Development</h5>

<p>The psychological benefits from regular tennis play may help children to learn and develop positive personality characteristics which are useful on the tennis court, but more importantly, are essential for many everyday situations through life. Regular tennis play has been demonstrated to improve:<br>
18. <b>Work ethic</b> because improvement through lessons or practice reinforces the value of hard work<br>
19. <b>Discipline</b> since you learn to work on your skills in practice and control the pace of play in competition<br>
20. <b>Mistake management</b> by learning to play within your abilities and realising that managing and minimising mistakes in tennis or life is critical<br>
21. <b>One-on-one competition</b> because the ability to compete and fight trains you in the ups and downs of a competitive world<br>
22. <b>Accept responsibility</b> because only you can prepare to compete by practicing skills, checking your equipment and during match play by making line calls<br>
23. <b>Management of adversity,</b> by learning to adjust to the elements (e.g. wind, sun) and still be able to compete<br>
24. <b>Effective accommodation of stress</b> because the physical, mental and emotional stress of tennis will force you to increase you capacity for dealing with stress<br>
25. <b>Learning how to recover</b> by adapting to the stress of a point and the recovery period between points, which is similar to the stress and recovery cycles in life<br>
26. <b>Planning and implementation of strategies</b> since you naturally learn how to anticipate an opponent’s moves and plan your countermoves<br>
27. <b>Learning to solve problems</b> since tennis is a sport based on angles, geometry and physics<br>
28. <b>Performance rituals before serving or returning</b> which help control your rhythm of play and dealing with pressure. These skills can transfer to taking exams, conducting a meeting or making an important sales presentation<br>
29. <b>Learning sportsmanship</b> since tennis teaches you to compete fairly with opponents<br>
30. <b>Learning to win graciously<b> while losing with honour</b>.</b> Gloating after a win or making excuses after a loss doesn’t work in tennis or in life<br>
31. <b>Learning teamwork</b> since successful doubles play depends on you and your partner’s ability to communicate and play as a cohesive unit<br>
32. <b>Developing social skills</b> through interaction and communication before a match, while changing sides of the court and after play<br>
33. <b>Having FUN…</b> because the healthy feelings of enjoyment, competitiveness and physical challenge are inherent in the sport<br></p>

<h5>Specific Considerations</h5>
<h5>Physical Capacities</h5>

How does the development of the various physical capacities in juniors and, more specifically, junior tennis players, progress, and at what age should physical training be started?<br>
<ul><li><b>Strength and Power :</b>Up to approximately age fourteen, boys and girls can perform conditioning exercises together. After age fourteen, the training groups should be split up, or tasks should be individualised due to physiological differences in strength, power, and growth<br>There is no consensus at what age tennis players should commence strength training. Historically, resistance training for the development of strength was not recommended for prepubertal children. It was believed that injury risk was too high, and that any strength improvement was negligible.<br>However, it has been shown that closely supervised, primarily concentric strength training programmes in prepubertal children may lead to significant increases in strength and to small increases in body mass, with low injury risk.</li>
	<li><b>Anaerobic Performance :</b>The anaerobic lactic system is less developed in children compared to adults. Children are not able to attain and sustain as high blood and muscle lactate concentrations during high-intensity exercises as adults, even relative to body size.<br>
This should be taken into consideration when young tennis players have to perform high intensity exercise (beyond their anaerobic threshold). Thus, the duration of high intensity (anaerobic) exercise should be shorter in children than in adults, and the rest periods between high intensity exercises should be longer than in adults.</li>
	<li><b>Co-ordination :</b>Middle childhood (age six to adolescence) is an important time period for the acquisition of co-ordination and complex technical skills.<br>
Children who start playing tennis around this age and experience a wide variety of games and sports will have a distinct advantage over children who do not have these experiences until a much later age.</li>
	<li><b>Flexibility :</b>Girls are more flexible than boys at all ages, and gender differences are greatest during the adolescent growth spurt and sexual maturation. It is important to put emphasis on the flexibility component, but the above mentioned aspect should be kept in mind.<br>
Stretching should be done gently. Also, stretching should be avoided after intense training programmes with a lot of eccentric exercises or when the player is very sore.</li>
	<li><b>Flexibility :</b>Children are at an increased risk during tennis in the heat. Children have a lessened ability to dissipate heat and are more susceptible to heat injury. Thus, young players should carefully observe the guidelines for extreme heat conditions and even more conservative measures may be applied.</li>
</ul>

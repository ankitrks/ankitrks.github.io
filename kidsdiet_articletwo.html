<h3><b><u>Planning Meals</u></b></h3>

Just as it is important to eat a well-balanced diet on a daily basis, it is equally important to eat the right things before, during, and after competition and training.<br>
The goal is to maximise your energy stores so you can meet the energy demands throughout the playing duration and to aid muscle growth and repair afterwards.<br>
To achieve this it is important to understand which foods to eat and when to eat them. However, it is important to eat foods that are familiar to you and are known to settle hunger.<br>

<h5>Pre-Match Nutrition</h5>
During the week prior to a competition a player must alter their general food intake and training plan to ensure they are optimally prepared for the competition. In order to achieve this, the athlete must attain two major goals.<br>
1. The athlete should gradually build up muscle glycogen stores.<br>
2. The athlete should become well hydrated.<br><br>

During the days prior to competition, players should replenish their carbohydrate stores (muscle and liver glycogen) so that they begin their competition with a full fuel supply. This is necessary because the majority of energy supply comes from the anaerobic systems, for which glycogen is the main fuel source.<br>
It is important to eat plenty of complex carbohydrate foods, especially those with a low glycemic index (GI) to help boost glycogen stores. Moreover, a progressive increase over several days in carbohydrate intake and an associated decrease in training intensity and duration (known as taper training) before the start of an event can better optimise the filling of glycogen stores.<br>
Up to four days before competition, as well as maintaining a high carbohydrate and fluid intake, it is important to have a little extra protein, up to 1.5-2 grams/kilogram, to ensure all tissues are fully repaired, and to support the production of creatine.<br>
When to eat in the 24 hours prior to a match can be tricky to determine. Unlike other sports, in tennis, there is often no way of knowing exactly when you will be competing, unless you are the first match of the day, and no way of knowing how long the match is going to last.<br>
Hopefully, by the morning of your competition, the previous day's eating will already have filled a player's glycogen stores. On the day of competition, a player should eat at least 90 minutes before a match, although ideally the pre-match meal should be consumed three hours before the match.<br>
This means if you have an early morning match at 9:00 am, you need to finish breakfast at the latest by 7:30 am. If you are not used to getting up this early to eat it is recommended you spend the weeks leading up to the competition getting into the routine.<br>
Sample meals would include for a breakfast: cereal and yogurt with toast and nut butter and fruit and water; for lunch: sandwich and pretzels with fruit and water.<br>
Your pre-competition meal should be high in carbohydrate, low in fat, low in protein, low in fibre (i.e. not too bulky and filling), enjoyable and familiar. If you really do not feel like eating, try to have a liquid meal such as a carbohydrate drink or dairy and fresh fruit.<br>
In addition, a pre-match snack of fast-absorbing carbohydrate just before you start playing can help to delay fatigue and enhance endurance. This snack should be consumed the hour before play.<br>
If you start exercising within about five minutes, an increase in insulin will be prevented and your blood-sugar levels will remain slightly raised for longer. But, do not eat a concentrated refined sugar source right before match time such as a soda or smoothie or candy.<br>
By late-morning / early afternoon the energy provided from breakfast will have been used. Therefore, it is important to have something to eat every two to three hours, but still remembering to leave at least 90 minutes before your match.<br>

<h5>In-Match Nutrition</h5>

Change of ends provides the ideal opportunity to take extra carbohydrate and water during the match, and helps to prevent, or at least delay fatigue, dehydration and maintain exercise intensity, particularly in the latter stages of a match.<br>
Recommended food & drinks on court:<br>
1. Cold fluids on each change over to replace lost fluids and cool the body temperature.<br>
2. Sports drinks are helpful to replace lost minerals (eg: salt) and provide energy.<br>
3. Moderate to high GI foods, such as high carbohydrate energy bars or non-caffeinated energy gels that are low in fat and protein digest rapidly and are a good source of quick energy.<br><br>

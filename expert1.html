<hr>
For us as parents, there is perhaps no greater thrill than to see our children succeed and flourish 

in their chosen field. But in a system like ours wherein academic prowess takes precedence above 

all else, raising a child who wants to become a sportsperson is not possible without our own active 

support and encouragement.

<h5>Sports as a lesson in life-skills</h5>

To be a sportsperson is not just about being a good cricketer, badminton player or athlete. Sports 

teach us more than just rules and athletic skill. Rather, it is the avenue through which children 

learn the most important life skills. Playgrounds are where children learn how to make friends. It is 

through sports that children learn the importance of both competition and cooperation. It is here 

that they learn what it means to be a team player and how to lead a team to victory; how to strike 

the right balance between an individual and a team identity and how to nurture both. Sports allow 

children to channelize their aggression and frustration into motivation and to not give up in the face 

of adversity.  And perhaps most importantly, sports teach children how to handle both failure and 

success and take it in their stride. Allowing the child time and opportunity to play will ensure that 

they are ready to take on life and whatever challenges come their way, both on and off the field. 

<h5>Striking the Right Balance:</h5>

Children into sports are often going to experience a conflict between academics and sports, and 

there’s no single easy solution to the dilemma. Yes, focusing on academics may be a safer option 

and can open up several professional options later in life, at the end of the day what matters is what 

your child wants to achieve out of life. 

Once a child figures out his strengths and weakness areas, it’s often a better idea to invest in 

harnessing one’s strengths to reach one’s fullest potential rather than getting bogged down by trying 

to improve upon one’s weak area. Take a strength oriented approach; nurture your child’s talents.

At the same time, don’t despair; remember that a good sportsperson has all the skills to do well 

academically as well – good attention and concentration, the motivation to work hard, discipline,

and the grit to overcome hardships and failures. 

<h5>Do’s and Don’ts for Parents:</h5>

<h6 class="inline">• The effort counts, not the result:</h6> What matters is not whether your child wins or loses, but rather, 

how he played the game. Focus on the effort your child puts in, not necessarily the outcomes. 

Wins and losses are a part of every game – to expect your child to win each time would be unfair. 

Encourage the child to compete with himself and to up his own game, rather than focusing all his 

energies on how his teammates or opponents are playing. 
<br>

<h6 class="inline">• Respect your child’s preferences:</h6> Ensure that the desire to play this sport is coming from your child. 

Don’t force your own ideas and ambitions on your child. Is he enjoying the sport he’s playing, or 

would he rather be doing something else?
<br>

<h6 class="inline">• Love your child unconditionally:</h6>  Don’t let the outcome of one game affect your attitude or 

behaviour towards your child. Your child needs to know that you love him and appreciate him, 

irrespective of how he performs, be it at sports, academics or any other sphere of life. It’s important

for you to let your child know that your affection is contingent on his choice of activity or his 

performance. 
<br>

<h6 class="inline">• Model positive behaviour:</h6>  you may not always realize it, but your child does look up to you and 

learns his values by observing you. If you want your child to grow up with a positive attitude and the 

right spirit, you need to behave the same. Model fairness, positive coping strategies, healthy conflict 

resolution and interpersonal communication and respect. 
<br>

<h6 class="inline">• Inculcate the right attitude:</h6>  talk to your child about what it means to be a sportsperson. It’s 

important that your child knows that ends don’t justify the means. Ensure that your children have a 

healthy sense of self-confidence and teach them the value of humility and self-assurance. 
<br>

<h6 class="inline">• Stay away from the blame game:</h6> blaming unfair referees, poor equipment or other extraneous 

factors for your child’s poor performance will only encourage your child to do the same. Instead, 

stay away from blaming others and help your child foster a sense of accountability and responsibility 

for his actions. It’s only when you child understands the consequences of his actions that he will be 

able to work harder and improve upon his own performance. 
<br>

<h6 class="inline">• De-individuate from your child:</h6>  it’s a very natural desire for parents to live their own unfulfilled

dreams vicariously through their children. This, however, can become a burden for the child, who 

is likely to have aspirations of his own. Don’t use your child’s talents to seek or define your own 

identity.  Remember that your child is an individual in his own right; appreciate and encourage your 

child’s uniqueness, allow him to set his own targets and define his own goals. Respect your child for 

whatever choices he makes. Your role is limited to encouraging and supporting your child, and no 

more. 
<br>

<h6 class="inline">• Don’t be critical of your child:</h6> open and honest feedback can help your child do better. But be 

cautious about how you give this feedback. Negative feedback, if at all, must be specific and 

accurate. Make sure you don’t criticize your child in front of anyone else. At the same time, don’t be 

stingy with appreciation and accolades for your child. 
<br>

<h6 class="inline">• Help in problem solving, when required:</h6> your child, may at times, get carried away and set 

unrealistic targets for themselves. Make sure your child knows that you’re available if and when 

they need your help. When required, help your child gain an objective perspective and guide them in 

their endeavours. 
<br>

<h6 class="inline">• Don’t take away the fun:</h6> children play sports because it’s what they enjoy doing. Don’t nag your 

child or turn practice sessions into a chore. Doing so will only reduce your child’s interest, motivation 

and performance in the game. What matters most is not the child’s skill at the game, but how much 

fun he has while playing. 
<br>

<h6 class="inline">• Let your child be a child:</h6> No matter how far your child may excel at his sport, at the end of the day, 

he is just a child. Have a relationship with your child outside the sports ground as well; make sure 

your child has a normal and happy childhood that he can cherish all his life.

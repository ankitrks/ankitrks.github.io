<h5>Carbohydrates</h5>
<ul><li>The best source of energy, providing fuel for your muscles, brain, and organs.</li>
	<li>Carbohydrate is stored in the body in the form of glycogen.</li>
	<li>Too few carbohydrates lead to glycogen depletion, which may lead to early on fatigue on court.</li>
	<li>Carbohydrates should represent about 60% of the calories in your diet.</li>
	<li>Found in cereal, bread, pasta, potatoes, rice, legumes, fruits, vegetables, and sports products (energy bars or sport beverages).</li>
</ul>

There are two types of carbohydrates – simple (sugars) and complex (starches). Sugars are simple carbohydrates. They are called this because the body digests them quickly and easily.<br>
Starchy carbohydrates are referred to as complex carbohydrates. These carbohydrates take longer to digest than simple carbohydrates. It is generally recommended that complex carbohydrates be consumed, especially those with a low glycemic index (GI) because they have high fibrer and vitamin contents and give a sustained energy release over a long period of time.<br>
However, liquid carbohydrate sources and foods containing simple carbohydrates may be used when it is necessary to raise the glucose level quickly during training or a match.<br>
For tennis players, the glycemic effect can be very important, and it is critical that players understand which carbohydrates they should consume and when.<br>
Both pre-and post-match, choosing higher glycemic index foods can provide quicker energy and quicker recovery, but in the general training diet, it is recommended that players choose lower glycemic index foods to maintain a consistent blood sugar and energy level.<br>
This is discussed in detail in the Planning Meals section.

<ul><li>The GI rating, which ranges from 1 to 100, lets you know how quickly foods are changed into glucose. The faster the food is converted to blood sugar (glucose), the higher the rating.<br>
Glucose is taken as the standard, with a value of 100. Values of 70 or higher are considered high, 56 to 69 medium and 55 or less low. The scale (right) shows the GI values for some popular foods.<br>
However, keep in mind if you consume a food in combination with other nutrient categories, such as protein and fat, the glycemic index will change and be less of an issue.</li>
<li>Carbohydrates are stored as glycogen in the liver, which helps to maintain normal blood glucose, and in skeletal muscle, where it is used as a source of fuel for muscular activity.<br>
Muscle glycogen is the main source of fuel used by the muscles to enable you to undertake both aerobic (with oxygen) and anaerobic (without oxygen) exercise, and may become a performance limiting factor during tennis, especially during long matches.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Fats</h5>
<ul><li>Fat sources in the diet are an important source of energy during long matches and training sessions, but is not meant to be the main energy source for tennis play. Fat also helps maintain the player’s appetite over longer so that he/she will not get hungry during play.</li>
	<li> Too little fat may lead to vitamin deficiencies and organ damage and possibly weaken the immune system.</li>
	<li>Too much fat increases the risk for heart problems, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure.</li>
	<li>  Fat takes the longest time to digest thus it is not a good source of quick energy during exercise.</li>
	<li>Fat should represent about 20-30% of the calories in your diet (minimum of 30-40 grams/day), but up to 80-100 grams/day for elite player’s energy needs.</li>
	<li>Found in butter & oils, dairy products, nuts, olives, avocado, mayonnaise, dressing, meat & fish, fast food, and chocolate.</li>
</ul>
There are two main types of fats: saturated (normally found in animal fats, except fish), and (mono or poly) unsaturated fats (normally found in vegetable fats, oil, and fat fish).<br>
Fats are a denser calorie source containing nine calories per gram, while carbohydrates and protein contain only four calories per gram. Ideally, on a heart healthy diet, players should choose twice as much vegetable origin fat vs animal origin fats.<br>
Vegetable fats are considered essential - you need small amounts daily to help make hormones and help with regularity and healthy skin and hair as well as a secondary energy source for training.<br>


<h5>Protein</h5>
<ul><li>Protein is crucial for meeting muscle and organ building and repair in the tennis player’s body. Protein is not meant to be an energy source on the court.<br>
Protein is becoming increasingly important for recovery needs between matches and after tennis play to help players return to the court in tip top shape. Latest research shows that players should consume an easy to digest form of protein within 30 minutes after tennis play.</li>
	<li>  Protein is the building block for hormones and enzymes that regulate metabolism and other body functions.</li>
	<li> Protein provides a small source of energy for muscles during exercise, but are not the ideal fuel.</li>
	<li>Too little protein may lead to tiredness, weakness, poor recovery and injury.</li>
	<li>More protein does not mean you will gain more muscle mass or strength.</li>
	<li>Proteins should represent only 10-15% of the calories in your diet.</li>
	<li>Found in meat, fish, eggs, dairy, poultry, vegetables and nutss.</li>

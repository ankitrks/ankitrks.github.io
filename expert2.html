<hr>

It’s happened to most of us at some time in our life, be it a final examination, a match point or a live 

performance – our results don’t always live up to the months and years of effort we’ve invested. 

Different people cope with pressure differently; some thrive under pressure while others crumble. What 

separates the top players from all the rest is not a difference in skill, but rather, this ability to thrive in 

the face of pressure. 

Many sportspersons work day and night to fine-tune their skill, do exceptionally well when practicing 

in the nets; yet are flummoxed when they are consistently unable to perform in the match itself. As a 

parent, you need to realize that it is the psychological processes that need to be addressed to ensure 

that your child can live up to his true potential. 

<h5>The Stress Performance Connection:</h5>

Stress isn’t always bad; a child who is not at all stressed about an upcoming match will not feel the need 

to practice at all. On the other, too much stress can be debilitating, not allowing the child to perform 

to his potential. A moderate amount of stress is optimal in ensuring that your child is motivated and 

prepared. 

<h5>When the Anxiety becomes overwhelming:</h5>

The fear of evaluation is a very real fear for many people, more so in the case of children. Performance 

situations are typically laden with anxiety – to have our peers and parents judge our performance can 

be overwhelming. As a parent, you therefore need to be sensitive to the child’s fears and concerns, and 

focus on reducing the child’s anxiety, rather than reprimanding him for his poor performance. 
<br>

<h6 class="inline">• Talking about fears and anxieties:</h6>  every child may have different concerns and apprehensions. Don’t 

judge to conclusions. Rather, encourage your child to talk about his fears. Doing so would also let your 

child know that it’s perfectly normal to be anxious during performances. 
<br>

<h6 class="inline">• Zoning-in:</h6>  It’s difficult to sustain one’s attention through long hours. Therefore, switching on and 

switching off between points is very important. Many athletes therefore adopt a small ritual – repeating 

a word or an action; a technique to signal the mind to ‘zone-in’ again. 
<br>

<h6 class="inline">• Enhancing Concentration:</h6>  Cricketers often get out, not because of a good ball but rather, because 

of a lapse in their own concentration. Falling prey to momentary distractions can have disastrous 

consequences for the game. The good news is that attention and concentration can be enhanced 

through practice – focusing on a single repetitive, monotonous activity for a designated amount of time. 

One such activity could be repeatedly hitting a table tennis ball against the wall for a span of 10 – 15 

minutes in the day. Another activity which can help players shut off auditory distractions is to listen to a 

piece of instrumental music with multiple instruments and following any one particular instrument.
<br>

<h6 class="inline">• Fostering self-confidence:</h6>  poor self- confidence shows in one’s posture, body language and attitude. 

The more confident your child feels about himself, the better he is likely to play. Don’t become overly 

critical of your child. Instead, focus on your child’s strengths, celebrate small successes and ensure that 

your child feels good about themselves, both on and off the field. 
<br>

<h6 class="inline">• Cognitive re-training:</h6> Having lost a game, one player may blame the weather, the equipment or the 

umpire for his loss. Another player might think of himself as a loser and consider himself good for 

nothing. A third player may think that he was outplayed by his opponent and needs to put in more effort 

to improve his games. The first of these players is likely to continue blaming external uncontrollable 

situations, without any improvements to his own game. The second player is likely to give up and quit 

playing all together. On the other hand, the third player is likely to try to figure out where he went 

wrong, and spend more hours practicing to improve upon his weak areas. At the end of the day, its our 

attitudes that shape outcomes, not our life situations. Encourage your child to have a positive, solution 

focused and goal oriented approach towards life. 
<br>

<h6 class="inline">• Inculcating the spirit of sports:</h6> True competition is when you compete with yourself, not with another. 

Help your child understand that the performance of others is never going to be in his control. His own 

effort is the only factor in his control. No matter how good one might be, someone better will always 

come along. Encourage your child to be his own benchmark.
<br>

<h6 class="inline">• Focus on effort:</h6> Winning and losing are just words. The final result is never entirely in our control, only 

our effort is. Focus on the importance of giving one’s best; help your child focus on effort, rather than 

get bogged down by expectations and results.

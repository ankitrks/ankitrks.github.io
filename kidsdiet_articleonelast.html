Protein consists of polymers of amino acids, the building blocks of all proteins. Some of these amino acids are considered essential, meaning that the body cannot synthesize them, and therefore must be obtained from the diet.<br>
Protein is used as an energy source when the glycogen stores are depleted and exercise is continued at a high intensity level. Players are advised to obtain necessary amino acids through consumption of natural, high quality protein foods, such as those mentioned above.<br>
The western diet contains more than enough protein, so protein supplementation may not benefit performance (Click here to view the Supplements section).<br>
In addition, if your diet is very high in protein, you will inevitably eat less carbohydrates, which means fatigue and a decline in performance may occur earlier as a result of glycogen depletion.<br>

<h5>Electrolytes/Minerals</h5>

<h5>Sodium</h5>
<ul><li>Sodium is the key electrolyte and main extracellular mineral lost in sweat and should be increased in most competitive tennis player’s diets to help minimize risk of heat illness and muscle cramping.</li>
	<li>Essential mineral for muscle contractions, fluid balance, and nervous system function.</li>
	<li>Too little sodium may lead to fatigue, headache, dizziness, and muscle cramps and heat illness.</li>
	<li>Too little protein may lead to tiredness, weakness, poor recovery and injury.</li>
	<li> Found in table salt, visibly salted foods such as pretzels, crackers and nuts; some natural food such as shrimp/prawns, and many processed foods such as cottage cheese or cured meats, canned vegetables, pickled foods, soups and sport beverages.</li>
	<li> Supplemental salt may be necessary for athletes who sweat a lot and do not eat high-sodium foods or use sport beverages. Heavy sweaters may need to add table salt in small amounts to sport beverages.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Calcium</h5>
Calcium is also a mineral lost in sweat as well as the key mineral for strong bone density in tennis players. Particularly for female tennis players, calcium intake should be emphasised.<br>
Consuming three dairy products per day is the key to help meet daily calcium needs. Supplementation may be needed if oral intake is low.<br>
<ul><li>Essential mineral for bone and teeth development (99% of calcium is used for this).</li>
	<li>Critical mineral for muscle contractions.</li>
	<li> Too little calcium will lead to poor bone health, tooth decay, and muscle cramps.</li>
	<li>Recommended daily intake: 1000-1300 mg.</li>
	<li>Found in cheese, milk, yogurt, ice cream, fish bones (sardines), watercress and spinach.</li>
</ul>


<h5>Iron</h5>
Iron is another key mineral because of its energy carrying capacity. Low iron levels are an issue in female tennis. Iron in the diet should be emphasized to avoid undue fatigue and anaemia risk.<br>
If blood levels are low, and anaemia (low blood iron) is diagnosed by a medical professional, iron supplementation may be warranted.<br>
<ul><li>  Essential mineral for red blood cells and the cardio-pulmonary system (heart & lungs).</li>
	<li> Found in hemoglobin which carries oxygen from the lungs to your working muscles.</li>
	<li>Essential for the production and release of energy.</li>
	<li>Too little iron may lead to tiredness.</li>
	<li>Recommended daily intake:12-18 mg.</li>
	<li>Found in red meats, poultry, fish, bran, spinach, vegetables, dried fruit (raisins, apricots and figs) and fortified cereal. Animal sources are better absorbed by the body.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Potassium</h5>
Potassium is the main intracellular mineral, so is often misunderstood as a key electrolyte to increase to minimize heat illness risk.<br>
This is not the case, but tennis players in general do need more potassium than the average adult as general body fluids decline with water losses.
<ul><li>Essential mineral for muscle contractions, fluid balance, digestion and nervous system function.</li>
	<li>Too little potassium may lead to tiredness, dizziness, vomiting and muscle cramps associated with hypoglycemia.</li>
	<li>Recommended daily intake: 3,000 mg.</li>
	<li>  Found in all fruits and fruit juices (especially bananas and melon), tomatoes and tomato juice, meat and dairy, green vegetables and bran.</li>
</ul>

Discouraged food & drinks on court:<br>
1. Avoid cola drinks or other soft drinks: they usually contain a large amount of sugar and the caffeine may act as a diuretic, which could increase your fluid output and may lead to more dehydration.<br>
2. Avoid bananas: they are slower to digest (low GI rating) and reduce your body’s ability to absorb the essential fluids you are drinking to avoid dehydration.<br>
3. Avoid fatty snacks such as a chocolate candy-bar: they are slow to digest and will sit in your stomach causing a feeling of fullness and reducing fluid absorption by the body.<br>

<h5>Post-Match Nutrition</h5>

After your match (or practice), your post-match nutrition becomes crucial for recovering from your energy depletion.<br>
The first goal is to rehydrate and resupply sodium.<br>
Then glycogen stores can take 24-48 hours to refill; therefore, it is important to start replenishing carbohydrates immediately following exercise to accelerate the recovery process.<br>
However, there may be very little appetite or opportunity to eat following a match. Drinking a liquid carbohydrate may be easier to consume and allows for glycogen replacement, restores lost electrolytes, and also promotes hydration.<br>
In addition, it is equally important to drink water since it takes three grams of water to store one gram of glycogen. Post-match protein intake in an easy to digest form, like a milk product or smoothie may be an ideal way to help your muscles to be able to immediately start to rebuild.<br><br>

<b style="font-size:14px;">Within the first 30 minutes after your match:</b> eat a large snack or medium portion dinner with 2 parts carbohydrates, 1 part protein, and sports drink or natural juices because:<br>
<ul><li>This is when your muscles are most effective at storing glycogen</li>
	<li>Your body is still using energy and burning calories</li>
	<li>Your cells are rehydrating</li>
	<li>A carbohydrate/protein energy bar or pasta/rice, lean meat, and a vegetable would be appropriate at this time.</li>
</ul>

<b style="font-size:14px;">Within 2-3 hours after your match: </b>
eat a well balanced meal including a variety of carbohydrate sources, a protein portion, and plenty of fluids because:
<ul><li>Your body is still low on fluids, minerals, and energy</li>
	<li>What you eat at this time will restore most of the energy used during play</li>
	<li>Your muscles begin repairing any damage that may have occurred in the match</li>
	<li> A pasta/rice based meal with lean meat and vegetables with several glasses of fluid make an ideal post-match meal.</li>
</ul>

<b style="font-size:14px;">Within 24 hours after your match: </b>continue to drink plenty of fluids and give your body a rest (if possible) because:<br>
<ul>
<li>It takes a while to fully recover from your match mentally and physically</li>
<li>It often takes a while to fully replace the fluid you lost during a match.</li>
<li>Your muscles need rest to store glycogen and repair themselves</li>
</ul>
If a player has another match scheduled to begin shortly after the completion of play (i.e. within 1-2 hrs), rehydration and carbohydrate intake should begin immediately.<br>
High-carbohydrate sport drinks, sport bars, and other high-carbohydrate foods with a high GI will facilitate the rapid restoration of muscle glycogen more so than other foods.<br>
Finally, if sweat losses from the previous match were extensive, and especially if the player is prone to, or just experienced cramps, additional salt may be added to the diet.<br><br>
